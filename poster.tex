\block{\blocktitlewrap{Introduction \& Data}}{

Taking advantage of currently acquired dense point clouds
we have extended a 2D forest fragmentation index developed for regional scale analyses \citep{riitters2000global}
into a 3D index for analyzing vegetation structure at a much finer scale.
We applied this method to a point cloud obtained by airborne lidar capturing
a suburban area with mixed forest cover.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{3D Raster}}{

We processed the lidar point cloud using a set of 3D raster methods
including 3D raster algebra.
Although this technique is rarely applied in the geospatial field,
it is as straightforward to use as well-established 2D raster and image processing methods.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{3D Fragmentation Index}}{

The 3D fragmentation index is based on \cite{riitters2000global}
and uses presence, absence, and configuration of lidar points in cells in a moving window.
The index is based on classification of $P_f$ and $P_{f\!f}$ values.
The $P_f$ value is computed as a ratio of occupied cells
(the y-axis direction in the figure below)
and the $P_{f\!f}$ value is computed as a ratio of fully versus partially occupied cell pairs
(the x-axis direction in the figure below).

Each image shows a horizontal slice for a given height.
The used colors are defined above with addition of light blue color for exterior.
% The areas in the north and north-east show only limited number
% of interior and a lot of transitional and edge class for the lower heights,
% while for the higher height a lot of interior and perforated class is visible.
%       The edges of these areas behave similarly with interior coming and disappearing sooner
%       indicating lower vegetation but with the same vertical structure.
% This is different from the area in the south-east corner with a lot of
% interior in the lowest levels but only exterior in the higher levels indicating
% dense low vegetation.

The index can be used to describe different types

The absolute count of interior cells (top right) shows
the whole south-east quadrant as mostly consistent
while the relative count (bottom right) shows it as two distinct groups.
The relative count of perforated cells (bottom left) also suggest
greater distinction of individual groups.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Source code for all the presented methods is provided.
 \item The 3D fragmentation index is implemented as a GRASS GIS module \citep{neteler2012grass}.
 \item The module is published in the GRASS GIS Addons repository
       alongside tools from other scientists \citep{chemin2015grass}.
 \item Helper tools such as the one for profiles were also implemented as GRASS GIS modules and published.
 \item We prepared a publicly available Git repository hosted on GitHub
       which contains the data for the study area, scripts to perform the analyses presented here,
       and details about the dependencies.
 \item Using Docker, this repository can be turned into a complete runtime environment
       to produce the figures and underlying data for this manuscript \citep{boettiger2015introduction}.
 \item We also connected the repository with a continuous integration service, Travis CI,
       which will show if the basic functionality was broken by any future changes.
 \item We leveraged and reviewed existing functionality and code in GRASS GIS.
 \item Algorithms and models included in GRASS GIS remain available long term \citep{petras2017innovations}.
\end{itemize}
